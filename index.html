        <p>So if all cities had the same geographic footprint, which would have the most people?  This chart shows the populations of the cities above, along with their surrounding metro areas for proper comparison.  The downtown populations are calculated using the population densities of concentric rings radiating out from the City Hall of each city.  Adjust the slider to set a common 'city limit' and see how many people live inside that limit in each metro area.  </p>
